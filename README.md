# VR + OpenHMD for Vulkan C++ examples and demos

This is a fork from https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan

Please see README-original.md for its README.

See BUILD.md for the original build instructions but make sure OpenHMD is installed and it's pkgconfig file is present.

This is tested only with Oculus Rift (CV1). It requires USB connection to be initialized before it's visible to X11 / Vulkan.

Only the multiview example might be meaningful for the VR glasses.
